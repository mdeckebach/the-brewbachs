        <h2>Details</h2>
        <p>We're excited to see you at our wedding on June 7, 2025! We're planning a small ceremony and casual reception with our closest friends and family.</p>
        <p><strong>Where:</strong> Our backyard! <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/mc2jsMP4S5pjVxWT9">2309 Sierra Highlands Dr, Reno NV, 89523</a></p>
        <p><strong>Attire:</strong> Wedding Casual. June in Reno can be hot, so wear whatever you will make you comfortable as most of the time will be spent in our backyard. That said, it can get chilly once the sun goes down so you may want to bring a layer. We have a large paver patioâ€”you may want to avoid stiletto heels.</p>

        <h2>Travel & Lodging</h2>
        <p>If you're flying, <a href="https://www.renoairport.com/">Reno International Airport (RNO)</a> is what you want. It's less than 15 minutes from our house.</p>
        <p>There are plenty of hotels to pick from. Anything in the downtown or midtown area is centrally located. There are also plenty of <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/reno-nv/stays">Airbnbs</a> if you're into that sort of thing. Everything in Reno is relatively close, but here are some options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.whitneypeakhotel.com/">Whitney Peak Hotel</a> - centrally located with a climbing wall</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.caesars.com/silver-legacy-reno">Silver Legacy</a> / <a href="https://www.caesars.com/eldorado-reno">El Dorado</a> - if you want the casino experience</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/rnowehx-hampton-suites-reno-west/">Hampton Inn & Suites Reno West</a> - the closest option to our house if you don't mind being in the suburbs</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h2>Things To Do</h2>
        <p>We love Reno! When not celebrating with us, here are some things to check out:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.renoriver.org/">Reno River Walk</a> - Take a stroll along the Truckee River. It's particularly scenic between Idlewild Park and City Plaza</li>
            <li><a href="https://flumetrailtahoe.com/path-bikes/">Bike Tahoe's East Shore</a> - Go early as parking can be competitive, especially on weekends</li>
            <li><a href="https://tahoerimtrail.org/">Tahoe Rim Trail</a> - Hike a bit of the rim around Lake Tahoe. We recommend heading north from either Brockway or Spooner Summits</li>
            <li><a href="https://theeddyreno.com/">The Eddy</a> - Outdoor hangout spot serving alcohol with food trucks and yard games</li>
            <li><a href="https://nvdm.org/">The Discovery</a> - Great for kids! Hands-on learning museum (for the Ohioans, think COSI/Imagination Station)</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.animalark.org/">Animal Ark</a> - Another great option for kids. <em>Fun fact: Cerena worked at this animal sanctuary after college</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Also, here are some of our favorite places to eat:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.arariomidtown.com/">Arario</a> - Korean Fusion. Reserve a table in advance</li>
            <li><a href="https://wildgarlicpizza.com/">Wild Garlic Pizza</a> - We mostly just like that they give you honey to dip your crusts</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.roycereno.com/">Royce Burger</a> - Gourmet burgers, but Michael doesn't understand the hype</li>
            <li><a href="https://locations.tacobell.com/nv/reno/5165-mae-anne-avenue.html">Taco Bell</a> - Our local TBell. Michael insisted on including this</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h2>Gifts</h2>
        <p>We are so fortunate to have each of you in our lives, and your presence is all we ask for! Please no boxed gifts. We just want to spend time together. For those insistent gift givers, please consider donating in our name to the <a href="https://www.pcta.org/">Pacific Crest Trail Association</a>, or you can contribute to <a href="https://venmo.com/u/Cerena-Brewen">our Honeymoon Fund via Venmo</a>.
        <hr>
        <h2>Q&A</h2>
            <p><strong>Will the ceremony and reception be indoors or outdoors?</strong><br>
            The ceremony will be outdoors in our backyard. The welcome hour and reception will be indoor/outdoor. That said, most of our available social space is in the backyard, so plan to be outside!</p>
            <p><strong>What will the weather be like?</strong><br>
                Hopefully perfect. By June, the sun is pretty strong in Reno, so the afternoons are usually warm with highs around 80 degrees. That said, there's low-to-no humidity, so it usually doesn't feel too hot in the shade. Temperatures in the evening usually cool to around 60 degrees.</p>
            <p><strong>Will transpoortation be provided?</strong><br>
                Unfortunately, we will not be providing transportation. That said, many of the hotels and casinos offer complimentary shuttles to and from the airport. Most people will choose to Uber or <a href="https://renocab.com/">take a taxi</a> to/from our house. We recommend scheduling ahead of time so everyone can get home safely. There is plenty of street parking, but please try to park along the empty lots north from our house to be curteous of our neighbors.</p>
            <p><strong>What about kids?</strong><br>
                We love kids! Please bring your little ones!</p>
